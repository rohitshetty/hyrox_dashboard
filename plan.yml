# PERIODIZATION OVERVIEW

periodization:
  - name: "Base"
    weeks: "1-3"
    runVolume: "38-42 km"
    hyrox: "Mini sims, station learning at race weight"
  - name: "Build"
    weeks: "4-6"
    runVolume: "38-42 km"
    hyrox: "Progressive sims: mini → 6-station, overload weight"
  - name: "Peak"
    weeks: "7-8"
    runVolume: "~42 km"
    hyrox: "Full 8-station simulations, long runs peak at half marathon"

# =============================================================================
# CYCLE PHILOSOPHY
# =============================================================================
cyclePhilosophy:
  base:
    name: "Base (Weeks 1-3)"
    philosophy: |
      Establish rhythm at ~40 km/week. Long runs start at 15K and build to 18K.
      Station technique and movement quality established through mini sims.

  build:
    name: "Build (Weeks 4-6)"
    philosophy: |
      Maintain ~40 km/week running. Long runs 15-18K continuing progression.
      Progressive hyrox sims from 4-station to 6-station. Introduce overload
      weight on sleds and carries so race weight feels manageable.

      New class cycle alignment: Bench Mon, Deadlift Wed, Squat Fri.
      Strength sessions complement class compounds.

      Key principles:
      - Steady ~40K weekly volume with long run progression
      - Race weight on all stations from Week 4
      - Overload weight (10-15% above race) introduced Week 5-6
      - Practice compromised running after station work
      - Master transitions - seconds lost add up across 16 transitions

  peak:
    name: "Peak (Weeks 7-8)"
    philosophy: |
      Full 8-station simulations. Week 7 with 800m runs, Week 8 with full
      1km runs (race distance). Long runs peak at half marathon distance (21K).
      These are your dress rehearsals and race time predictors.

      Key principles:
      - Full sim #1 (Week 7): 800m runs, record all splits
      - Full sim #2 (Week 8): 1km runs, compare to sim #1
      - Long runs at half marathon distance
      - Maintain strength but don't chase PRs
      - Identify and address weak stations between sims

  taper:
    name: "Taper + Race (Weeks 9-10)"
    philosophy: |
      Volume drops but intensity stays. Stay sharp without accumulating fatigue.
      Your fitness is built - now preserve it.

      Week 9: Abbreviated simulation maintains confidence and sharpness.
      Week 10: Minimal activation. Trust the training.

      Race day strategy: Control the first half. Attack the second half.
      Running: 8 x 1km @ 5:00-5:15 = 40-42 min
      Stations: Target 28-30 min total
      Transitions: Budget 2-3 min total (15-20s each)

# =============================================================================
# STRENGTH PROGRAM (Constant across all weeks)
# =============================================================================
# Deload weeks: reduce working weight by 15-20%, drop 1-2 sets per exercise
# Taper weeks: maintain weight, reduce total volume by 40%
