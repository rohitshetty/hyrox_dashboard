# =============================================================================
# CYCLE PHILOSOPHY
# =============================================================================
cyclePhilosophy:
  cycle1:
    name: "Base/Build (Weeks 1-3)"
    philosophy: |
      Focus on technique and movement quality over intensity. Get comfortable
      with each station individually. Build aerobic base for station work.
      Learn your natural pacing and identify weaknesses.

      Hyrox success comes from efficient transitions and sustainable pacing across
      8 running segments and 8 functional stations. Running accounts for ~50% of
      race time. This phase builds the other 50%.

      Key principles:
      - Train movements before adding intensity
      - Practice "compromised running" - running under fatigue after stations
      - Establish baseline times for each station
      - Mini sims rotate through push-dominant and pull/carry-dominant stations

  deload1:
    name: "Deload 1 + Full Sim (Week 4)"
    philosophy: |
      Reduced running volume allows your body to absorb 3 weeks of training stress.
      The full 8-station simulation is your first complete dress rehearsal.
      Treat it like race day - record all splits. This benchmark informs Cycle 2 focus.

      Strength deload: reduce weight 15-20%, drop 1-2 sets per exercise.

  cycle2:
    name: "Build/Peak (Weeks 5-7)"
    philosophy: |
      Progress to race-weight and overload work. Train heavier than race weight
      so competition feels manageable. Start combining stations to simulate
      race conditions. Build toward full race simulation in Week 7.

      Key principles:
      - Race weight on all stations from Week 5
      - Overload weight (10-15% above race) in Week 6
      - Full 1km run segments in Week 7 simulation
      - Address weakest stations identified in Week 4 sim
      - Master transitions - seconds lost add up across 16 transitions
      - Build mental resilience to push through accumulated fatigue

  deload2:
    name: "Deload 2 (Week 8)"
    philosophy: |
      Adaptation week after 7 weeks of progressive training stress.
      No hard hyrox work. Reduced running and strength volume.
      Movement maintenance only. Come back fresh for the taper.

  taper:
    name: "Taper + Race (Weeks 9-10)"
    philosophy: |
      Volume drops but intensity stays. Stay sharp without accumulating fatigue.
      Your fitness is built - now preserve it.

      Week 9: Abbreviated simulation maintains confidence and sharpness.
      Week 10: Minimal activation. Trust the training.

      Race day strategy: Control the first half. Attack the second half.
      Running: 8 x 1km @ 5:00-5:15 = 40-42 min
      Stations: Target 28-30 min total
      Transitions: Budget 2-3 min total (15-20s each)

# =============================================================================
# STRENGTH PROGRAM (Constant across all weeks)
# =============================================================================
# Deload weeks: reduce working weight by 15-20%, drop 1-2 sets per exercise
# Taper weeks: maintain weight, reduce total volume by 40%
