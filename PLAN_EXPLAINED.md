# Training Plan Explained

## Overview

This is a **10-week Hyrox race preparation plan** targeting a **sub-70-minute finish** on **April 13, 2026**. It combines high-volume running (~14–54 km/week), a 5-day strength program, and progressive Hyrox station work into a single periodized training block starting February 2, 2026.

The plan assumes access to a gym with SkiErg, rower, sled (push/pull), wall ball, kettlebells, dumbbells, and a barbell. There is **no sandbag available**, so barbell front-rack or zercher lunges permanently substitute for the sandbag lunge station on race day.

## Training Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Technique before intensity.** Learn station movements at sub-race weight before loading up. Poor form under fatigue costs more time than going slow.

2. **Compromised running.** Hyrox is not a running race or a functional fitness competition — it's both simultaneously. The ability to run at pace *immediately after* a station is the single biggest differentiator. This is trained explicitly throughout the plan.

3. **Progressive overload on stations.** Stations progress from sub-race weight (Weeks 1–3) → race weight (Weeks 4–5) → overload weight (Week 6, 10–15% above race weight) → back to race weight for simulations (Week 7). Training heavier makes race weight feel manageable.

4. **Benchmark, adjust, repeat.** Two full 8-station simulations (Weeks 4 and 7) act as dress rehearsals. Every split is recorded. Week 4 identifies weaknesses; Cycle 2 addresses them. Week 7 measures improvement and predicts race time.

5. **Control the first half, attack the second half.** This pacing strategy applies to both the overall race and each individual station. Going out too fast in Hyrox is punished severely in the later stations.

### Running Philosophy

Running accounts for roughly 50% of race time (8 × 1 km segments). The plan uses **Daniels-style pace zones**:

| Zone | Name | Pace | Purpose |
|------|------|------|---------|
| E | Easy | 9:00–7:00/km (HR-based) | Aerobic base, recovery |
| M | Marathon | 5:55/km | Race simulation |
| T | Threshold | 5:16/km | Lactate clearance |
| I | Interval | 4:50/km | VO2max development |
| R | Repetition | 4:30/km | Speed and running economy |

Running sessions are structured as:
- **Monday:** Easy run (aerobic base)
- **Tuesday:** Tempo run (threshold work)
- **Thursday:** Interval run (VO2max)
- **Friday:** Easy/optional (only if fresh)
- **Saturday:** Long run (endurance, negative splits, sometimes with M-pace segments)

### Strength Philosophy

The strength program is a **5-day bodybuilding-style split** that runs constant across all 10 weeks with volume/intensity modifiers for deload and taper weeks:

| Day | Focus | Key Lifts |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| Monday | Squat (Lower + Core) | Back squat, paused squat, split squat |
| Tuesday | Back + Biceps | Weighted chin-ups, rows, curls |
| Wednesday | Deadlift + Posterior Chain | Deadlift, hip thrust, farmer's carry |
| Thursday | Chest + Delts + Triceps | Bench, OHP, dips |
| Saturday | Arms + Delts (Pump) | Shoulder press, curls, skullcrushers |

**Recovery guardrails:**
- Squats heavy Monday → Deadlifts heavy Wednesday = OK spacing
- Never push both squat and deadlift to RPE 9+ in the same week
- If arms/delts feel flat, reduce deadlift volume before cutting upper work
- Deload weeks: reduce weight 15–20%, drop 1–2 sets per exercise
- Taper weeks (9–10): maintain weight, cut total volume by 40%

### Gym Classes

The plan includes daily "class" slots (e.g., "Class / Squat cleans", "Class / Plyo / Core"). These are **group fitness classes at the gym** — not prescribed training sessions. They are scheduled around the main training and loosely aligned with the day's focus (squat-focused class on squat day, etc.). On deload and taper weeks, classes are kept light or optional.

---

## Periodization Structure

The 10 weeks follow a **3-on / 1-deload** block periodization model, repeated once, followed by a 2-week taper:

```
Weeks 1–3    Cycle 1: Base/Build     (45 → 48 → 52 km)
Week 4       Deload 1 + Full Sim #1  (30 km)
Weeks 5–7    Cycle 2: Build/Peak     (50 → 54 → 54 km)
Week 8       Deload 2                (35 km)
Weeks 9–10   Taper + Race            (42 → ~14 km)
```

### Cycle 1: Base/Build (Weeks 1–3)

- Running volume climbs from 45 → 52 km
- Hyrox stations introduced individually, then in mini simulations of 4–6 stations
- Sled work progresses from sub-race weight to race weight
- Mini Sim A (push-dominant), Mini Sim B (pull/carry-dominant), Mini Sim C (6-station dress rehearsal)
- Run segments between stations are 600m at 5:30/km (sub-race distance and pace)

### Deload 1 + Full Simulation (Week 4)

- Running drops to 30 km
- Strength deloaded (–15–20% weight, –1–2 sets)
- **Wednesday: Full 8-station simulation #1** — all stations at race weight with 1 km runs between. This is the first complete dress rehearsal. Every split is recorded as a benchmark.

### Cycle 2: Build/Peak (Weeks 5–7)

- Running volume builds back to 50–54 km
- All stations at race weight from Week 5
- **Week 6: Overload week** — sleds at +18 kg (push) and +12 kg (pull) over race weight, carries at +4 kg, lunges at +5 kg
- Run segments between stations increase to 800m at 5:15/km
- **Week 7: Full 8-station simulation #2** — full 1 km runs between stations. Best predictor of race performance. Compare all splits to Week 4.
- Friday sessions shift to "race-pace compromised running" — full 1 km runs after stations at 5:15/km

### Deload 2 (Week 8)

- Running drops to 35 km
- No hard Hyrox work — easy flow and movement maintenance only
- Strength deloaded
- Purpose: absorb 7 weeks of training stress before the taper

### Taper + Race (Weeks 9–10)

- **Week 9:** Running at 42 km. Abbreviated 4-station sim at full race intensity. Saturday long run simulates Hyrox running pattern (8 × 1 km at race effort). Strength maintains weight but cuts volume 40%.
- **Week 10 (Race Week):** Running drops to ~14 km. Monday shakeout + light strength. Wednesday optional activation. Thursday strides. Friday–Saturday rest. **Sunday: Race Day.**

## Hyrox Race Reference

### The 8 Stations

Each station is preceded by a 1 km run. The race is: Run → Station → Run → Station × 8.

| # | Station | Distance/Reps | Weight | Target Time | Key Cue |
|---|---------|--------------|--------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | SkiErg | 1000m | — | 4:30–5:00 | Start at 2:20/500m split. Rhythm, not power. |
| 2 | Sled Push | 50m | 152 kg | 3:00–3:30 | Low position. Short choppy steps. Never stop. |
| 3 | Sled Pull | 50m | 103 kg | 2:00–2:30 | Steady hand-over-hand. Don't death-grip. |
| 4 | Burpee Broad Jumps | 80m | — | 4:00–4:30 | 8 × 10m chunks. Consistent 1.5m jumps. |
| 5 | Rowing | 1000m | — | 4:00–4:30 | 2:10–2:15 splits. 26–28 SPM. |
| 6 | Farmers Carry | 200m | 2 × 24 kg | 2:30–3:00 | Quick steps. 2 short breaks max. |
| 7 | Sandbag Lunges* | 100m | 35 kg barbell | 4:00–4:30 | Slow is fine. Just don't stop. |
| 8 | Wall Balls | 100 reps | 6 kg, 3m target | 4:30–5:00 | 10 × 10 or 5 × 20. Break from the start. |

*Substituted with barbell lunges (front rack or zercher) due to no sandbag access.

### Race Day Time Budget

| Component | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Running (8 × 1 km @ 5:00–5:15/km) | 40–42 min |
| Stations (all 8) | 28–30 min |
| Transitions (16 × 15–20s) | 2–3 min |
| **Total** | **Sub 70:00** |

## How to Read the YML File

The file `plan.yml` is the single source of truth for the entire training plan. Here's how it's structured:

### Top-Level Sections

```yaml
meta:               # Race metadata (date, goal, duration, equipment)
paces:              # 5 running pace zones with targets
periodization:      # High-level overview of the 5 training phases
cyclePhilosophy:    # Detailed philosophy text for each phase
strength:           # The 5-day strength program (constant across all weeks)
weeks:              # The 10 weekly plans with day-by-day detail
hyroxReference:     # Station targets, technique cues, race strategy
```

### The `weeks` Array

Each entry in the `weeks` array represents one training week:

```yaml
- week: 1                    # Week number (1-10)
  dates: "Feb 2-8"           # Calendar dates
  phase: Base                # Training phase name
  runVolume: "45 km"         # Total running volume for the week
  philosophy: "..."          # Plain-text summary of this week's focus
  days:                      # Day-by-day schedule
    monday:
      slots: [...]           # Time slots for the day
    tuesday:
      slots: [...]
    ...
    sunday:
      rest: true             # Rest days have no slots
```

### The `slots` Array (Daily Schedule)

Each day contains an array of time slots. A slot represents one training session:

```yaml
slots:
  - time: "5:00-6:00"       # Time window
    type: run                # Session type (see below)
    session: "Easy Run"      # Human-readable session name
    distance: "7 km"         # For runs: distance
    details: "Steady E pace" # For runs: pace/structure details
```

#### Slot Types

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `run` | Running session. Has `distance` and `details` fields. |
| `strength` | Strength training. Has `ref` pointing to the strength program. |
| `hyrox` | Hyrox station work or simulation. Has `workout` with detailed blocks. |
| `class` | Gym group fitness class (not prescribed). |
| `rest` | Intentional rest or skipped slot. |
| `race` | Race day. |

### Strength References (`ref`)

Strength slots use a `ref` field instead of inline exercises:

```yaml
- type: strength
  session: "Squat Day (Lower + Core)"
  ref: strength.monday       # → look up strength.monday for exercises
```

The `ref` value is a dot-path into the top-level `strength` object. The session name may include suffixes like `- Accessories`, `- DELOAD`, or `- TAPER` to indicate which part of the program or what intensity modifier applies. The exercises themselves don't change — only the weight and volume modifiers described in `recoveryGuardrails`.

### Hyrox Workout Structure

Hyrox slots contain a nested workout structure:

```yaml
- type: hyrox
  session: "Mini Sim A - Push Dominant"
  duration: "50 min"                    # Approximate session duration
  warmup: "5 min easy row + dynamic"    # Optional warmup instructions
  workout:                              # Array of training blocks
    - block: "Mini Simulation"          # Block name
      notes: "..."                      # Optional block-level notes
      exercises:                        # Array of exercises in this block
        - name: "Station Circuit"
          prescription: |               # Multi-line workout prescription
            Run 600m @ 5:30/km
            SkiErg 500m
            ...
          rest: "2 min between rounds"  # Rest between sets/rounds
          notes: "..."                  # Exercise-specific notes
    - block: "Grip & Carry"            # Second block in same session
      exercises:
        - name: "Farmers Carry"
          prescription: "3 x 100m @ 22 kg each hand"
          rest: "60s"
  cooldown: "5 min stretch"             # Optional cooldown instructions
```

### Hyrox Reference Section

The `hyroxReference` object at the bottom of the file contains race-day reference data that doesn't change week to week:

```yaml
hyroxReference:
  stationTargets:      # Array of 8 stations with distance, weight, target time, strategy
  technique:           # Technique cues per station (array of strings)
  raceDayStrategy:     # Time budget breakdown + mental cues per station
  raceDayChecklist:    # Morning, arrival, warmup checklists for race day
```

### Key Conventions

- **Multi-line text** uses YAML `|` (literal block scalar) for philosophy, prescriptions, and notes. Whitespace and newlines are preserved.
- **Optional sessions** are marked with `notes: "OPTIONAL - skip if fatigued"` or similar.
- **Deload/taper modifiers** appear in the session name (e.g., `"Squat Day - DELOAD"`, `"Back + Biceps - TAPER"`, `"Squat Day - RACE WEEK"`). The exercises are the same — only weight and volume change per the guardrails.
- **Progression markers** in Hyrox prescriptions show weight relative to race weight (e.g., `@ 130 kg (sub race weight)`, `@ 152 kg (RACE WEIGHT)`, `@ 170 kg (+18 kg over race)`).
- **Sunday** is always a rest day (`rest: true` with no slots).
- **Friday evening run** is always optional and conditional on fatigue.
